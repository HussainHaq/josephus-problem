# josephus-problem
This program will execute the josephus problem.
The problem is known as the Josephus Problem (or Josephus permutation) and postulates a group of people of size N >= 1 are standing in a circle waiting to be eliminated. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. After a specified number of M >= 1 people are counted, the M^th person in the circle is eliminated. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and counting the same number of people, until only one person remains.
